# 🧑‍💻 Job Board Backend - ProDev BE

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the backend for a **Job Board Platform**, developed as part of the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**.  
The system facilitates **job postings, secure role-based access control (RBAC), and efficient job search features**.  

The backend integrates advanced database optimization techniques, modular APIs, and comprehensive documentation for seamless integration with frontend clients.
